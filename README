# chronic

Chronic is a simple terminal application using the ncurses library, which
displays the current time and date as ascii art, in a similar manner, that
`tty-clock` does, but automatically centers the content, and contains a progress
bar for the current year (inspired by the @year_progress Twitter app).

Its only dependencies are a C/C++ standard library, ncurses, and pthreads.
As such, this code is easily portable between various operating systems.
Also, GCC and GNU Make are required for building the software.
